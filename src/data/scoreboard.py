        Split the current Scoreboard class into two:
            - scoreboard (subclass of game, only showing minimum data of a game like the status, score, away and home etc...  )
            - game (for the overview, load all the static data like players, away and home teams etc... on init 
            and have methods to refresh the dynamic data like score, goals, penalty etc...)
